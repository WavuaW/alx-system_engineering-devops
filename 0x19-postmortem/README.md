Issue Summary:

On March 5th, 2023, our cloud storage service experienced an outage from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM PST. During this time, users were unable to upload, download, or access their files. The outage affected approximately 75% of our users, resulting in significant disruptions to their daily workflows.

Root Cause:

The root cause of the outage was a hardware failure in one of our storage servers. The server had a faulty disk, which caused data corruption and made it impossible to access the affected files.

Timeline:

12:00 PM PST: The outage was first detected by our monitoring system, which detected a high rate of errors on the affected server.

12:05 PM PST: An engineer was alerted to the issue and began investigating the cause.

12:15 PM PST: The engineer identified the affected server and attempted to restore access to the files.

12:30 PM PST: After further investigation, it was determined that the server had a faulty disk that needed to be replaced.

1:00 PM PST: The engineer escalated the issue to our infrastructure team, who began coordinating the replacement of the faulty disk.

2:00 PM PST: The faulty disk was replaced, and the affected files were restored. The service was fully operational again.

Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:

Initially, our engineer suspected that the issue was caused by network connectivity problems, as some users were reporting slow upload and download speeds. This led to some time being wasted on troubleshooting the network configuration before the root cause was identified as a hardware failure.

Actions Taken:

Once the issue was identified as a hardware failure, our infrastructure team coordinated the replacement of the faulty disk. During the outage, we provided frequent updates to our users through our social media channels and email communications.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a faulty disk in one of our storage servers. The disk was replaced, and the affected files were restored. Going forward, we will implement additional monitoring to detect and prevent similar hardware failures.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we will take the following corrective and preventative measures:

Increase monitoring of disk health and implement alerts for potential disk failures.

Improve our disaster recovery plan to minimize the impact of hardware failures.

Increase redundancy in our infrastructure to reduce the likelihood of widespread outages.

Conduct regular reviews of our systems and processes to identify areas for improvement.

Develop a communication plan to notify users of outages and provide updates on the status of the service.

Conclusion:

We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this outage and are committed to providing a reliable and high-quality service to our users. We have taken steps to address the root cause of the issue and will continue to improve our systems and processes to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
